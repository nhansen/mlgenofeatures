In order to run mlgenofeatures, this directory should contain
assembled haplotypes in fasta files, to be used for simulating
read data and calculating k-mer features from sequences with
the various genotypes.

To use HPGP haplotypes, download the fasta files from the links
in the file assembled_hpgp_haplotype_urls.txt using the 
command:

> for url in `cat assembled_hpgp_haplotype_urls.txt`; do wget $url; done
> for fasta in `ls HG*fa.gz`; do samtools faidx $fasta; done
