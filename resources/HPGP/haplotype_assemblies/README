In order to run mlgenofeatures, this directory should contain
assembled haplotypes in fasta files, to be used for simulating
read data and calculating k-mer features from sequences with
the various genotypes.

To use HPGP haplotypes, download the fasta files from the links
in the file assembled_hpgp_haplotype_urls.txt using the 
commands:

# download fastas:
for url in `cat assembled_hpgp_haplotype_urls.txt`; do
    wget $url;
done

# bgzip compress and index:
for fasta in `ls HG*fa.gz`; do
    gunzip -c $fasta | bgzip -c > $fasta.bgzip
    mv $fasta.bgzip $fasta
    samtools faidx $fasta;
done

Once they are properly compressed and indexed, these files can
be used as base haplotypes for the mlgenofeatures pipeline.
