h1. Simulating k-mer count features with SimSVs

p. SimSVs is a Snakemake pipeline that can be used to create files of
k-mer counts from short reads simulated from a diverse set of
mutated haplotype reference sequences.

p. These k-mer counts can then be used to train random forest 
classifiers to recognize the simulated mutations in real whole
genome datasets.

h2. Software dependencies

The SimSV pipeline requires:

* Snakemake (https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* ART version ART-MountRainer-2016-06-05 (https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/index.cfm)
* meryl version 1.3 (https://github.com/marbl/meryl)
* Python with the pysam library (https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
